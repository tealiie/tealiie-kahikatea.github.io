    <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5><br>
    <p>Trust is very important in any foundation for solid relationsip. Without it, I feel that we don't allow ourselves to fully express our ideas and opinions or participat and in turn synergy is not able to be achieved. A kind and understanding environment is cruicle to allow people to feel safe to be vulnerable and for trust to be formed.</p><br>

    <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5><br>
    <p>I have yet to try empathic listening because I haven't really had any conversations lately that was indepth, mainly just quick check ups to see how everyone is doing. In previous chapter I really enjoyed the techniques used for mindful listening, I found it really helped me understand what the message the speaker was trying to convey. Will try to incorportate techniques in empathic listening in the future.</p><br>

    <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5><br>
    <p>It was so calming! I feel like we are always so stressed out in daily life and when we have differing opinions we don't always try to view it from the other person's perspective, believing we are right and become the victim in the situation. I found that the loving kindness meditation took away the personal emotions and replaced it with kindess and understanding to help see the bigger picture. Overall, I found this really calming and help remind me that opinions don't always mean that someone is right and someone else is wrong. I will try to remember the loving kindness mediation to use in the future so that I could be more understanding that sometimes we just see things differently.</p><br>

    <h5>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h5><br>
    <p>I remember this year just after the New Years rush, I was at the mall. More specifically in the parking lot. I saw that a car was ready to leave so I stopped my and indicated. The car was quite long and took a while to reverse, they would back out, shift the car, move back in and then reverse again. While this was happening, another car (Car A) pulled up opposite me. It couldn't move because the reversing car was taking up all the space. As the reversing car managed to fully pull out of the parking space and drive away, I was preparing to drive into the now vacant spot. However Car A sped and cut off my car to take the parking spot. I quickly slammed on the brakes and beeped my horn. I remember the incident vividly because the I was moments away from having the front of my car smashed in. I rolled down my window and shouted to the lady that she almost hit my car and that I was already waiting. The reckless driver of Car A got out of her car and started swearing and shouted profanities as she walked away. I was so angry at how rude she was and how absolutely dangerous it was. If I had driven any faster into the parking spot, she would've hit my car or even me. It's just plain etiquette, if you see another car already waiting for a parking space, you move on. You don't steal it from them. It's just being civilised.<br><br>

    When looking at the situation from the other driver's point of view, maybe they didnt't see that my car was already there. Or they were really in a rush to go into the shops.<br><br>

    However, whether they were in a rush or not, it doesn't excuse someone from driving recklessly.</p><br>
