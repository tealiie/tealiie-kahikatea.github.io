    <h2>Motivation</h2><br>

    <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5><br>
    <p>I feel it's a great way to live life if you are able to sustain motivation by living through the purpose lens. Finding the motivation each day to do something isn't always easy, and if you don't love what you are doing it usually doesn't lead to happiness and in time you just become even more demotivated and unhappy. Sure you work and count down the days until your next holiday which only really gives you happiness in a short burst before you go back to daily life and look for the next high milestone to work towards. That kind of motivation is short term and feels so forced. I find that people who are most happy and energised each day about their life are those who strive or have a purpose that is higher than themselves. This is something I've always observed but this week's reading really explained why this way of living will lead to more sustained motivation and happiness. I guess it's beneficail to have a DMN to figure out how you can live your life through the purpose lens and be more motivated and happy.</p><br>

    <h5>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise.</h5><br>
    <p>What are your core values? I value honesty, compassion and selfessness. I believe that one should always be true to yourself, in terms of honestly expressing who you are, how you live life and your beliefs. It is pointless to live a life that doesn't resonate with what you truly believe in. In turn I feel that you should also have compassion and be selfless. That if you are able to, be kind and help your family, friends and contribute to the community. Giving back to those less fortunate and random acts of kindess, however small can create positive ripple effects.<br><br>

    What do you stand for? I stand for equality and mutual resepct. That everyone deserves to be treated fairly despite differences in opinions across various aspects of life.

    <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5><br>
    <p>I find that the ideas are very good, and all seem very famliar. Previously I have heard that if you visualise something you are more likely to acheive it because that dream or idea becomes more tangible. Hence why vision boards are something I keep hearing people day you should create and also to journal your thoughts and ideas to help keep you motivated to stay on track to complete those goals. </p><br>
