    <h1>SPRINT 1: Reflection</h1><br><br>

    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3><br>
    <p>The program emphases a holistic approach to learning which is very different to the traditional delivery method of education that you see in schools. It promotes a community style of learning where the collective as a whole is stronger than it’s single parts. We learn through self discovery and also through collaboration. I might not have the answer but someone else could know the steps and we would work together towards a solution. This approach simulates a real world work place where more likely than not, I will be working in a team and with other departments, so it's enbaling me to develop necessary soft skills. It’s a very interesting way of learning and I look forward to the coming weeks.<p><br>

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3><br>
    <p>I really like this idea of collaborative learning because it recognises and acknowledges the benefits of working together. Whether it be in a school or the workforce, interdependence is inevitable amongst people for a successful outcome. So to see EDA adopt these principles makes me really excited about learning in such a unique environment.</p><br>

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3><br>  
    <p>Similar to those situation where you dip a toe in, to test out the waters before jumping into a lake. It’s quite a shake up from the academic style I’ve grown accustomed to so I’m still getting used to everyone being so HELPFUL. Don’t get me wrong, I think its wonderful and ridiculous in all the best sense of the word and it’s so refreshing. I’m still threading lightly, getting into the grove of how things work at EDA but I can definitely see myself embracing this open culture. From day one I can already see the mutual kindness and respect everyone has for another in the cohort, and I really look forward to meeting, learning, growing and working with everyone.</p><br>

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3><br>
    <p>Nope, nada, no. My expectation of EDA came from scouring the internet for online reviews from past students and also a testimonial from a friend’s boyfriend who was down in Wellington for his cohort. So before starting Phase 0, I had a fairly confident vision of what EDA offered and if this week was anything to go by, the program delivers exactly what they promise. I can most definitely reassure friends and skeptical family members that this program isn’t a hoax and if you put in the effort and dedication over the next several months great things will happen. You get out as much from EDA as you put in, it’s not going to be an easy walk in the park but it will definitely be worth it.</p><br>

    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3><br>
    <p>Excited? Yes, and also terribly nervous. I have somewhat of a love hate relationship when it comes to working with people, which I need to overcome in order to really succeed within this collaborative learning environment. I’m a people person and thoroughly enjoy the creative process of working with others however, a fault of mine is the reluctance to ask for help. Already during this week, I struggled on a problem for over 2 hours, I read through the concept materials again, searched online, looked through previous slack messages for answers and was half tempted to throw my laptop at the wall because they say if you hit something really hard, that’s how you’ll get it working (but I don’t think this was the case). That frustration they talk about with coding…yeah…I already got myself a one way ticket for that ride. Being strapped for time, I ended up sending a DM to one of the other cohort members and within 5 minutes of them explaining a concept I had trouble understanding, I had completed the task. It wasn’t all too bad because like all great sitcom shows, I learned a lesson at the end. That it’s ok to ask for help and the advantages of this learning environment is that it breaks down barriers so you’re not struggling on your own but rather work together towards a common goal.</p>
