    <h2>Self Confidence</h2><br>

    <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5><br>
    <p>The terms are interchangeable to me, they both describe a state of mind where we are consciously aware of our emotional and physical being in the present moment. By being more mindful we can have gain more understanding and control of our mental state.</p><br>

    <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5><br>
    <p>I tried the body scanning, it’s something I’ve done before in during yoga. It can be a bit difficult to relax and focus on the body scan since my mind is always jumping from one thought to another, but once I calm my mind down, it’s really relaxing and I find I am able to focus better.</p><br>

    <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5><br>
    <p>I feel like it’s an interesting concept to not have your emotions define yourself. It’s always been common thinking that your emotions are a manifestation of you and that’s why sometimes you do things out of the norm, because your emotions made you do it, ie. emotionally binge eating, retail therapy when stressed, irrational behaviour when angry. By viewing emotions as being seperate from one self I guess you can learn to have better control of them and not act out when emotionally charged.</p><br>
