    <h2>Meditation Process</h2><br>

    <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5><br>
    <p>It was really really hard shifting my focus on going through the motions of code, test, redo and have a simple website that worked over one that looked good. When I caught myself spending too much time on the aesthetics of the page I try and think back to “process over product” and change my focus so that I would work on the structure and process of turning the wireframe into a live webpage rather than picking the right background colour. I still think I spend too much time on making the page look nice rather than focusing on the overall process, so that is something I can work on improving. I think planning out how much time to spend, then setting a timer or reminder would be a good idea so I am more mindful of how much time I am spending on an aspect and move on if I am taking too long.<p><br>


    <h5>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h5><br>
    <p>I think there are many benefits to medication, as discovered in last week’s video. I am a little skeptical on the profound change 7 weeks can have. Probably because the few times I have tried the 2 minute mindfulness exercise I find myself drifting off into a thousand different thoughts and it’s so hard to focus, even for 2 min on nothing or my breathing.<p><br>


    <h5>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h5><br>
    <p>I learnt that there is no “wrong” way to meditate and that when your mind wanders and you bring it back into focus is a form of meditation so not to are too much when I find myself distracted during the mediation sessions. That if something catches your attention it’s okay to acknowledge it and then go back to focus on breathing. A benefit of long term mediation is being able to achieve a state of calm and alertness which will lead to happiness, because that is the mind’s natural state, which is something I found quite interesting. Also the concept of attention and meta-attention, that through meditation you can train your mind to become less distracted and gain focus more quickly.<p><br>


    <h5>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h5><br>
    <p>The technique of the posture to be in for mediation is something I would like to try, maybe that will help focus.<p><br>


    <h5>Any other musings?</h5><br>
    <p>Mediation is so interesting, I didn’t realise how much it can affect one’s mental health and change the brain’s natural activity.<p><br>
