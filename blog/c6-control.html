    <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5><br>
    <p>What triggers me off when I code is situations when I write code and the end result is met with a blank screen. Case in point, when creating the grid for minesweeper it was super irratating whenever I refreshed the page and it was blank. It meant that somewhere in my code, something wasn't correct, maybe it was the syntax, maybe I wrote the wrong code. But just having a blank screen stare back at me didn't give an indication of where I was wrong so it was hard know what to I needed to correct. This often made me quite frustrated and demotivated especially if after mant attempts I could cannot get the code working. Sometimes, using trouble shooting methods would work and other times I would avoid the problem, so then it takes me forever to finish a sprint, this isn't a very productive process.</p><br>

    <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5><br>
    <p>I think it was an interesting method of learning how to control your reaction to emotions so that you don't let your emotions overtake your actions and act inpulsively. However, my critisim is that even if you notice and reflect, sometimes it's hard to see the situation from the other person's perspective and try to understand where they are coming from. And even if you notice the situation and your emotions, unless you wanted to, you don't necessarily reflect and carry forward with the response. </p><br>
