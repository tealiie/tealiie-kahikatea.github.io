    <h2>Leadership</h2><br>

    <h5>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5><br>
    <p>Compassionate leadership is the highest level of happiness, where an apparent sense of concern for suffering of others and want to end suffering is shown. "I" becomes "we", where the aims and goals progress beyond personal achievement and instead collectively strives for a greater good. When using this as a criteria to evaluate if compassionate leadershio has been shown, no particular examples from my past comes to mind. That's not to say that the leaders were selfless and only cared about themselves. Just that no leaders really stand out. But now that I know this, I feel that I will become more aware of situations next time and evaluate if someone is being a compassionate leader.</p><br>

    <h5>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h5><br>
    <p>I found it a little comical because all I could envison were floating hearts, like in a cartoon. I also kept hiccuping and getting disrupted so didn't feel that I was able to achieve goodness. However the meditation was very positive. Focusing on creating goodness, in a way changes my persepctive to not only dwell on the negative, which is so easy to do and become discouraged more easily.</p><br>

    <h5>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h5><br>
    <p>This meditation was difficult, since there was a lot to focus on. It's hard not to think of negative thoughts without focusing on them intently. I see the benefit of turning those negative thoughts and transforming them into positive energy, reinforcing the "resolve that nothing can overcome us". When imagining talking to a version of myself during the meditation I felt it was very calming, and vivid. That I was able to think more objectively about a situation without being overwhelmed by emotion. It was also thought provoking to imagine viewing things from another person's perspective, it created understanding and took away prejudice.</p><br>

    <h5>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h5><br>
    <p><strong>Status: </strong>In terms of knowledge growth I feel that my status has grown from Sprint 1 to now., I haved learnt so much and gained a new understanding of emotions from the readings and meditation techniques from Search Inside Yourself. Right now I'm mostly aware of my own status and abilities, this will change during bootcamp as I will be in a collaborative environment where there can be a knowledge and skills difference amongst the cohort. And I would have to learn how to work well together when everyone is bringing different skills to the challange.<br><br>

    <strong>Certainty: </strong>So far during phase 0, there hasn't been a lot of uncertainty, however this can all change daily during bootcamp as each day we are met with new challenges and learning new skills.<br><br>

    <strong>Autonomy: </strong>Stress is inevitable, I've always been the type to try and handle it all on my own. I'll have to learn that during bootcamp there will be times I can't control everything and that I will have to ask for help, and that thats ok.<br><br>

    <strong>Relatedness: </strong>The weekly check ins were really great as it helped to become familiar with the rest of my cohort. This ensures that when bootcamp starts I won't see them as absolute strangers ("foes") because we have met before. Although sharing the same space for so many hours a week will help to transition from foe to friend as we will be experiencing the same emotions of learning and creating new material. We will be able to relate more in terms of hitting road blocks, debugging and also share in moments of joy as we are able to create products with the code we've learnt.<br><br>

    <strong>Fairness: </strong>I will try to be fair when working with others.</p><br>
